### Week1-Lecture-workflow

1. This week was an introductory class. I learnt about deepnote platform. It is an all in one platform to write code, markdown, terminals and also has a file management system to upload files directly. I like the platform very much. Especially how everything is integrated into one. 

2. I worked on a starter project where I created ipynb, py, markdown files to test how they work. Markdown is an awesome way to organise lecture notes. It has pre defined headers like h1 h2 etc to distinguish the headings etc.

3. I learnt about some basic python functions like range etc. 

4. The professor also explained about every week assignments, readings, using github to finish tasks every week.
